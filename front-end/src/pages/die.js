          There were many different kinds of dinosaurs that lived during the
          Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 million years ago to 66
          million years ago. It's estimated that there were over 1,000 different
          species of dinosaurs, but not all of them lived at the same time.

          Dinosaurs can be divided into two main groups: Saurischians and
          Ornithischians.

            Saurischians are meat-eating dinosaur's like Trex, Veliciraptor as

            Ornithischian dinosaurs include the horned and frilled dinosaurs

              Apatosaurus lived during the late Jurassic Period, about 157-146
              million years ago. There was a minor mass extinction toward the
              end of the Jurassic period. During this extinction, most of the
              stegosaurid and enormous sauropod dinosaurs died out, as did many
              genera of ammonoids, marine reptiles, and bivalves.
